            <p>
              The mission of Guard the Lion Shrine is to maintain a
              long-standing Homecoming Week tradition of guarding the Nittany
              Lion Shrine and putting on related programming and events for
              students, alumni, and friends.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Held immediately after the Homecoming parade every year, Guard The
              Lion Shrine is one of the longest-standing traditions which
              features live music, free food, games, and activities all centered
              around the Lion Shrine. Accompanied by Penn State ROTC volunteers
              who stand watch of the symbol of our best, guarding the Lion
              Shrine is a true representation of Penn Stateâ€™s pride and
              community.
